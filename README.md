# 2025: My Year In Review
## written by Richard Pham 

Some thoughts I'd like to share on the internet about my year of 2025. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This year has been bland to my social life. I was not settled in the professional and financial senses. In September of 2022, 
I had to relocate back to my hometown in South Florida and have stayed quite put here ever since. Looking back, it was like 
I got banished from the place I relocated to, Portland of Oregon. I don't have much to say on the state of affairs of Portland 
of Oregon since the city clearly has a progressive swing to it but surrounded by the deep red suburbs and farmlands, Portland's 
progressivism did not make a positive difference to my time being there, as my money kept getting drained while housing was of 
a quality very much like the stereotypical Black crack community epidemics of the 1980's. I guess what I can say, confidently, 
is that making progress requires making an effort to change things, ideally to improve things. So Portland's foray into letting 
in all these newcomers, me included during my college years, was noble but deficient. It is just that Portland is actually a very 
Caucasian area, not only any ole Caucasian, but predominantly of the Nordic Germanic English variety. The ghettos are where 
normal newcomers have to find housing. The rich newcomers, not normal in other words, could easily buy some space for housing 
in a gentrified area, free from the pestilence of those troublesome populists. Some examples are rich Chinese and oil tycoon 
affiliates of Arabia.  

Focusing my discussion on my year in 2025, where I did not spend a single second in Portland of Oregon but Port Charlotte of 
Florida, I'd like to say how disappointed I am by the industrial disparity of America. How can a country such as America be 
so great in some rankings, yet be so unfair and cruel to many of its nationals, the citizens that were born and raised here? 
Florida is an anti-industrial state. If there weren't more English street signs and more stores with English names on them, I 
could have guessed that this part of Florida was in a Caribbean country or even in Southeast Asia. But what do I know, right? 
I've been called stupid and retarded and foreign by some of the people here. I read, in the news about half a year ago, on 
Florida's real estate crisis (a major conspiratorial milieu of scams). I don't have any hard numbers on that phenomena, since 
I am not an investigator by profession. But it's headlines such as this, coupled with Florida's stubbornness to industrialize 
on a scale comparable to California or even Texas, not to mention Florida's post WW2 role as a retirement state (retired New 
Yorkers loveeee Florida), that do not spell good things out for some people willing to work hard, people with industrial skills 
and all, only to see their potential dwindle and ail as much as some of the residents here, sick from being lazy and playing 
along with political trends of bullying and wargaming, that clearly don't give a rat's ass about anyone but themselves, maybe 
their relatives, maybe even having sex with their own relatives due to the Trump trend of populism, which in turn has proven 
very effective at reinforcing xenophobia to the point where I cannot imagine some people fornicating with anyone else but their 
own relatives. People like the fictional character, Norman Bates. Yes. Yes. Thank you so much, populism without the industry. 
Thank you. The America South is different, in many senses from the Global South. See, the Global South is comprised of workers 
predominantly in mass production sectors. Today's American South does not have the same Confederacy, per se. But it believes 
so much in tradition, while the rest of the world is moving on, some moving forward into worse places such as war in the 
Slavic states, industrial depression in Japan, faltering of Chinese economic growth porkbarreling into Vietnamese modernization. 
That is in the Eastern hemisphere. The American South has issues, from what I've read and experienced. The issues interplay with 
mass media's overpromising of a brighter future, higher education's deluding of its students into thinking the United States 
has really become very cosmopolitan and globalist. But the American South today is honestly no worse off than some of the areas 
of the American Rust Belt, a region that really bellied out after 1975 as other nations, many in Asia, took after Japanese 
enterprise to seize parts of the corporate pie, factory production. With that said, there is a kind of embarrassment some people 
inevitably feel when they try to mix modernity, technological advances, and other forward paradigms with tradition, historical 
values, family trees and legacies, those things that cannot possibly benefit the unprivilegd any more than it curses them into 
similar dismal fates that are written in the history books, as part of harsh but necessary lessons for future generations to 
recognize so they can avoid them. I read an article yesterday, titled "Florida helped launch the space race. Now we can power 
the AI revolution" by the Tampa Bay Times. The article made for a really good laugh, in my opinion, humble opinion I'd like to 
clarify. Here is why. The "space race", or whatever it really was, was actually not that great to a lot of Americans, slavic 
peoples, and did not really give a damn about most Asian peoples except for some select Chinese ones that helped with the 
scientific development, only to turn out to be spies working for China or Taiwan (I can't remember which is which with them 
two sometimes). The "space race", in more cynical terms, was actually something like Alexander the Great's big, great, and 
ambitious proposition to storm into Persia. Alexander did do that but died unexpectedly. Do not get me wrong. I love engineering 
projects. I enjoy lectures by scientists, mathematicians, and other serious scholars. But what I think of when I hear of the 
phrase, "space race", is politics and competition. People love sports. Be that as it may, the "space race" was not a cherry 
dairy time for many people, including some of the prominent science headmasters running the programs. A lot of fear and loathing, 
and the rare celebration when a project that took billions of dollars finally succeeded to completion: a rocket launched from 
Earth to space, in order to prove that not any kind of humanity can do those things, but humanity that resulted from American 
grit, determination, and ingenuity. Here in South Florida, as I spend my days unemployed, there is a questionable part of town 
where I go for groceries. The location is the Public plaza. There are always these characters there. I think there's cameras and 
security there or something, and the "security" (deadbeat paramilitary wannabes) eyeball people they don't like or like too much 
(what difference does it make with those effed up characters). Yeah. Yeah. There's no "space race" or "AI race" in this part of 
South Florida. All I see is most Americans struggling to get by, and I'm not going to mince words on this other matter: the 
Haitian migrants that sort of have to be criminal hustlers to feed themselves. Haiti is not a role model of a country, I'll just 
leave the mention dangling at that. Maybe the American Democratic Party is partly responsible...who knows...but a country that 
blames all its problems on other countries cannot be a country in its own mind, see what I'm saying? 

In the early part of 2025, I was supposed to have joined the US Navy. But shortly after boot camp, I decided I was not having it. 
I made the decision that I could suffer in another way and hopefully, end up in a better place instead of joining the US Navy, 
an organization that is defunded and mismanaged in ways unimaginable to the American public, and having to serve years in it to 
end up with a middle-class house to my name. The US military is not really known for its transparency. I'd say its greatest 
intellectual assets, nowadays, are from aerospace engineers and rocket scientists. And those people are usually contracted out 
to do work for the US military rather than directly join it. I'd bet a rat's ass that there's going to be a critic or a hater that 
reads up on my biography, and tells everyone "Richard Pham is a coward, a broken mentally ill man" because I actually had the nerve 
to go through with my decision to exit the military while the night is still young. Living in a country that says it values 
"freedom" and "independence", and then not being able to find a stable job that guarantees financial stability, and then having to 
join the military more as a "last resort" to escape financial problems rather than any kind of genuine patriotism that cannot be 
recited like these cute little sailor anthems, is a kind of madness due to coercion by socioeconomic techniques. Don't get me wrong 
here. I'm not the one that always chickens out instead of going up to take a beating. But just taking a look at the state of 
affairs... who would I be fighting for? Would I even fight if I served in the US Navy, or would I just loaf around and sit on 
ships all day? Serious questions I had before bootcamp. I made my decision to exit because my soul told me so. Patriotism has never 
been about who is and isn't officious, who is and isn't a sycophant, who is and isn't born into a rich family. Those things matter 
for the reputation. But war is fighting for reputation, you see. 

After I quit the US Navy boot camp, I came back home. And that was the continuation of household problems. The women in my 
household have this emboldened sense of righteousness. Morality comes from them, or should I say... they like to think that 
morality comes from them. My little sister took up a new degree of annoyance, attitudes that she was intent on radiating out to 
me. She became something like a "plant". A "plant". She uses this high-pitched tone of voice talking about little things like 
food, how to make food, what food to eat, what this person on her Tiktok feed says, always playing Tiktok videos. Kuwaii culture. 
HEEHEEHEE. I will say that being around my nuclear family, predominated by the "feminine side" of things, really turns me off from 
Asian women. Seriously. If one already is imperfect, one should not make these fanciful gestures to try to be perfect. I know 
stereotyping is bad. I don't know... I just don't know... is this really a golden age for America or is this American toxic masculine 
decadence, impotence spurred by feminist treachery, and consumerism alive and well? A parallel to Germanic mental deterioration as 
their own corporations turned more foreign and their money supply turned more fiat in the years leading up to WWII? Must people have 
to go back to farming and mining and laboring in order to find themselves, to not be so damn artificial in this age of artificial 
intelligence? 

I was able to publish some refined algorithmic work, ideas that were swirling around my head, from the months leading up to my graduation 
and in the off-time I spent observing the world of nature co-existing with humanity. I gained practical skills in cryptography and computing, 
in my independent studies. I got into a terrible accident and I am grateful to be alive in the way I am right now. 

Right now, I am making a solid effort to divorce myself from troublesome affairs. Social media, for example. I quit Facebook when all 
my school friends ditched it. Now I am quitting LinkedIn since there is a lot of this A.I. hysterical hype on there. Marketing people. 
There is one guy there that is always going on about how great Rust is and how awesome modern C++ is. It's like he's juggling between 
marketing Rust to readers while educating himself on how to use C++ more effectively. I think my collegiate years have really corroded 
my ability to make new friends on one hand. On the other hand, my freshman year of college introduced me to some tenets regarding friendship: 
how friendships turn usurous, friendship for utility and gain. So I guess my lack of real interaction with people to be friends is actually 
due to the lack of utility, I suppose, and also to the skepticism forged by education while press articles talk about these atrocities 
and betrayals happening left and right. I am also not commenting on MSN news articles anymore, since there is a lot of ragebait and angry 
people on there. Last but not least, I am avoiding international affairs that clearly do not favor me. For example, the US military branches, 
such as the Navy, have recently started focusing on the Venezuelan concern. The CIA bombed a factory there not more than a week ago. From a 
naive perspective... wow, that escalated quickly. But then I took some time to read up on Maduro, and Maduro really does look like a hamfisted 
brute. People say that Trump is hamfisted, but in comparison with Maduro, Trump's "war crimes" are nothing exceeding socialist villainy. 
Maduro is a modern example. How can Venezuela be so rich in resources and so mismanaged to get to where it is at? It is like asking, how 
could Vietnam have let itself get taken over by France when Vietnam had all these resources? Or how could Chinese have become opium addicts 
from doing business with British opium middlemen that sourced their product from India? Why is the sky blue? Another matter that I am 
definitely avoiding is the whole China-Taiwan drama. I truly do not see anything good coming out of this xie-xie-Xua-Xe drama going on. 
China, from what I read, wants to be the world defender of the "Global South". Very ambitious. No one is going to stop them for just wanting 
to be that, I'll tell you that right now. This whole military buildup, this Japanese opportunism to remilitarize, this Vietnamese techno-modernization 
effort now that China has lost favor with Western banks... not good for a lot of people, despite their skin color. Not good whatsoever. I rest 
my case and am not going to think more on these foreign affairs unless I am pressed to. I have my own life, my own interests, my own loves to 
think about. And instead of reading press articles every day, I should probably go to church every once in a while instead. 

New Year's Resolution in. All this other stuff... out.
